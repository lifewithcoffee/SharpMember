# TODOs

- Clear tasks (see `task list` pane)
- Change member Id to Guid (all root object's ID should be GUID, then internal
  object's ID uses int)

---

- Apply global package & runtime configs
- Add shouldly to xunit (purpose: improve code and message readability)
- GitHub action pipeline to deploy to AWS
- Build REST interface and JS sdk (using openapi sdk generator)
- Build Angular client app

# Conventions

- Aggregate root object has the same name with the namespace and the relevant folder
